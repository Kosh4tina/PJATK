##### Project 1: Bit Calculator  

A program that implements a calculator of basic mathematical operations,  
in which all operations will be performed using bitwise operators.  
  
Enter two natural numbers from the keyboard and then one of the four characters (+, -, *, /) mathematical operations.  
Perform bitwise mathematical operations according to the assigned sign on the values provided.  
Stop the program when both entered numbers are zero.  
  
Exemplary performance of the operation:  
Enter the first number: 5  
Enter the second number: 2  
Provide operations: +  
5 − 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 0101  
2 − 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 0010  
7 − 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 0111   
  
#### Project 2: Fruit Basket  
  
A program for sorting a two-dimensional array filled with objects.  
  
Three algorithms were used for sorting:  

* Insertion Sort  
* Selection Sort  
* Buble Sort  
  
**Example of using**

You can use an existing filled array or uncomment a piece of code where objects will be created randomly.  

#### Project 3: Little Town

A program that allows you to create cities, fill them with houses, people, things, etc.

Streams, a self-written database were used here to save and update the results of adding and a lot of interesting things.
